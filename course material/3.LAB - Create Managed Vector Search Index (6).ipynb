How to make a\\ntrade-off between data, computing resources, and predictive performance is worth studying.\\nModel Variety There are many attempts at model design, such as generation-based models in the CV\\narea. However, GAN-based approaches are not popular for the following two reasons: 1) the discriminator\\nhas learned meaningful feature representations, but they are forgotten during training [273]; 2) the mode\\ncollapse causes the generator to output samples in singular mode to cheat the discriminator. As a result,\\nalthough researchers attempt to apply GAN-based approaches on SSL for pretraining, the difﬁculties in the\\nconvergence of discriminator and divergence of generator hinder development and progress in this area.\\nModel Compression With the wide application of the Transformer and the pretraining model showing a\\ngeneral trend of growth, the computational complexity of the pretraining model has become the focus of\\nattention. Due to the huge hardware requirements of model training and other reasons, the high threshold\\nmakes it difﬁcult for researchers to train from scratch. BERT-base and GPT-3 contain about 108 million\\nparameters and 175 billion parameters, respectively. It is not conducive to the development of relevant\\nresearch work. There are some works for pretraining model compression, such as ALBERT having fewer\\nparameters and better effect than BERT-base. The improvement models still require powerful computing\\nequipment, making them difﬁcult to apply universally. Reducing the high computing cost is one of the main\\nchallenges in future research.', 'score': 0.5752995}\n\n{'file': 'dbfs:/Volumes/dbacademy_arxiv/v01/arxiv-articles/2302.09419.pdf', 'text': 'Some defense approaches have been pro-\\nposed to defend against such attacks. [268] designs an auxiliary anomaly detection classiﬁer and uses a\\nmulti-task learning procedure to defend against adversarial samples. On the other hand, some defects in the\\nPFM may be inherited by the custom models in transfer learning, such as the adversarial vulnerabilities and\\nbackdoors mentioned above. To mitigate this issue, [269] proposes a relevant model slicing technique to\\nreduce defect inheritance during transfer learning while retaining useful knowledge from the PFM.\\nData Privacy in PFMs LLMs and other PFMs have been trained on private datasets [270]. The re-\\nsearchers have discovered that by querying the massive LMs, it is feasible to recover speciﬁc training sam-\\nples. An adversary may, for instance, obtain IRC discussions and personally identiﬁable information. Even\\nworse, because large models have so many parameters, it is simple for PFM to memorize or learn private\\ninformation, making larger models more prone to attack than smaller ones. Many PFMs such as the LLMs\\nhave been trained on private datasets. The researchers have found that it is possible to recover individual\\ntraining examples by querying the LLMs. For instance, an adversary can extract examples including per-\\nsonally identiﬁable information, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) conversations. Even worse, because of the\\nbillion parameters of large models, it is easy for PFM to learn private information, making the larger model\\nmore vulnerable than smaller models. We must take privacy-preserving measures into account during all\\nPFM processes, including data processing, model training, model inference, and system deployment, in\\norder to reduce the risks of privacy leakage.\\n8 Future Research Challenges and Open Problems\\nThe PFM can avoid training models from the scratch, which is a breakthrough from weak AI to general AI.', 'score': 0.5703862}\n"

    "In this lab, you learned how to set up a Vector Search index using Databricks Vector Search for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. By following the tasks, you successfully created a Vector Search endpoint, connected a Delta table containing text embeddings, and tested the search functionality. Furthermore, using a re-ranking library, you re-ordered the search results from the most relevant to least relevant documents. This lab provided hands-on experience in configuring and utilizing Vector Search, empowering you to enhance content retrieval and recommendation systems in your projects."
